## User Story
AS a BEER LOVER
want to know about all of the craft breweries in my area (or in areas I plan to visit)
SO THAT I can enjoy beers everywhere I go

WHEN I visit the website / app
I am first asked for my name and zip code
THEN I am provided with an output of nearby breweries as well as the option to search under a different zip code
